              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) affects over 20 million Americans and millions more worldwide in the UK, 
                Canada, Australia, and Europe. It occurs when the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), 
                causing metabolism to slow down significantly. This leads to unexplained weight gain (even with diet and exercise), 
                extreme fatigue and low energy, feeling cold all the time especially hands and feet, dry skin and brittle hair, 
                constipation and digestive issues, depression and brain fog, muscle weakness and joint pain, and difficulty losing 
                weight despite eating less. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause (autoimmune condition attacking the 
                thyroid gland), affecting 90% of hypothyroid cases in developed countries.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The key challenge with hypothyroidism weight loss is that a sluggish thyroid slows your basal metabolic rate (BMR) 
                by 20-40%, meaning you burn 200-600 fewer calories per day at rest compared to someone with normal thyroid function. 
                The foundation of successful hypothyroidism weight loss lies in <strong>optimizing thyroid medication dosage</strong> 
                (work closely with your endocrinologist to ensure TSH levels are in optimal range 1-2 mIU/L, not just "normal"), 
                eating thyroid-supporting foods rich in selenium, zinc, iodine (if deficient), and tyrosine, avoiding goitrogenic 
                foods that interfere with thyroid function when consumed raw and in excess, maintaining adequate protein intake 
                (0.8-1g per pound of body weight) to preserve muscle mass and boost metabolism, managing stress and cortisol levels 
                (high cortisol worsens thyroid function), getting 7-9 hours quality sleep nightly (poor sleep disrupts thyroid hormones), 
                and combining diet with strength training exercise to rebuild metabolism. This comprehensive hypothyroidism diet plan 
                focuses on nutrient-dense whole foods, metabolism-boosting nutrients, anti-inflammatory foods, and balanced macros 
                (35% protein, 35% carbs, 30% healthy fats) designed specifically for optimal thyroid function and sustainable weight loss.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                People with hypothyroidism face unique metabolic challenges that make weight loss 40-60% more difficult than those 
                with normal thyroid function. Understanding the science behind thyroid-related weight gain is essential for developing 
                an effective strategy that actually works despite a sluggish metabolism.

                    <TrendingDown className="w-6 h-6 mr-2" />
                    1. Dramatically Slower Metabolism (BMR Reduction)
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                    Low thyroid hormone levels (T3 and T4) directly decrease your basal metabolic rate (BMR) by 20-40%. This means 
                    if your normal BMR should be 1,500 calories per day, hypothyroidism can reduce it to 900-1,200 calories daily. 
                    You're burning 300-600 fewer calories per day just existing, which equals 1-2 pounds of extra weight gain per 
                    month if calorie intake stays the same.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                    Thyroid hormones regulate how every cell in your body uses energy. When levels are low, mitochondria (cellular 
                    powerhouses) produce less ATP (energy), cells burn fuel more slowly, and your body switches to "energy conservation 
                    mode" storing more calories as fat. This is why thyroid patients gain weight even while eating normally or dieting.

                <div className="bg-orange-50 p-6 rounded-lg">

                    2. Severe Fatigue Leading to Reduced Activity
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                    Hypothyroidism causes profound, debilitating fatigue that makes exercise feel impossible. Low thyroid hormones 
                    reduce ATP production in muscles, causing weakness and early exhaustion. You burn far fewer calories through 
                    daily activity (NEAT - non-exercise activity thermogenesis) and formal exercise, compounding the metabolic slowdown.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                    Even simple activities like walking, climbing stairs, or household chores become exhausting. This activity reduction 
                    can decrease daily calorie burn by another 200-400 calories. Combined with lower BMR, you're burning 500-1,000 fewer 
                    calories daily than someone with normal thyroid function, making weight gain inevitable without intervention.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div className="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg">

                    <Target className="w-6 h-6 mr-2" />
                    3. Water Retention and Fluid Accumulation
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                    Hypothyroidism causes significant water retention and edema (swelling), particularly in the face (puffy appearance), 
                    hands, feet, and abdomen. Low thyroid hormones impair kidney function and reduce ability to excrete excess fluid. 
                    Mucopolysaccharides (sugar-protein compounds) accumulate in tissues causing myxedema (thick, doughy skin swelling).
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                    This fluid retention can account for 5-15 pounds of "weight gain" that isn't actually fat. While frustrating, 
                    this water weight typically resolves within 4-8 weeks once thyroid medication is optimized and metabolism improves. 
                    Many patients lose 10+ pounds of water weight in the first month of proper treatment.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
                  <h3 className="font-semibold text-xl text-blue-800 mb-3 flex items-center">
                    <Flame className="w-6 h-6 mr-2" />
                    4. Decreased Muscle Mass (Sarcopenia)
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                    Hypothyroidism accelerates muscle loss (sarcopenia) because low thyroid hormones impair protein synthesis and muscle 
                    tissue maintenance. Since muscle tissue burns 3-5 times more calories than fat tissue even at rest, losing muscle 
                    further slows metabolism in a vicious downward spiral. Thyroid patients often have 10-20% lower muscle mass.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                    Preserving and rebuilding muscle through adequate protein intake (0.8-1g per pound body weight daily) and strength 
                    training exercise 2-3 times weekly is absolutely critical for hypothyroidism weight loss. You must fight muscle loss 
                    aggressively to restore metabolic rate and create sustainable fat loss.

                      If you have Hashimoto's (autoimmune hypothyroidism), consider eliminating gluten for 3-6 months. Research shows 
                      70-80% of Hashimoto's patients improve significantly on a gluten-free diet due to reduced autoimmune antibodies. 
                      Gluten molecular structure resembles thyroid tissue, triggering autoimmune attacks (molecular mimicry).

              Essential Supplements for Hypothyroidism & Weight Loss

                Work with your endocrinologist to optimize thyroid medication first (TSH goal: 1-2 mIU/L, not just "normal range"). 
                These supplements can support thyroid function, improve T4-to-T3 conversion, and accelerate weight loss when combined 
                with proper diet and medication.

                  <ul className="text-sm text-gray-700 space-y-3">
                    <li>• <strong>Selenium:</strong> 200mcg daily (or 2 Brazil nuts). Essential for T4-to-T3 conversion. Don't exceed 
                    400mcg daily. Most important supplement for hypothyroidism.</li>
                    <li>• <strong>Zinc:</strong> 30mg daily with food. Required for thyroid hormone production and T3 receptor function. 
                    Deficiency common in hypothyroid patients.</li>
                    <li>• <strong>Vitamin D3:</strong> 2,000-5,000 IU daily (test blood levels first, aim 50-70 ng/mL). Deficiency 
                    worsens hypothyroidism and weight gain.</li>
                    <li>• <strong>Magnesium:</strong> 300-400mg daily (glycinate form). Required for thyroid hormone production, muscle 
                    function, and metabolism.</li>

                    <li>• <strong>Omega-3 Fish Oil:</strong> 1,000-2,000mg EPA+DHA daily. Reduces inflammation (especially for 
                    Hashimoto's), supports metabolism.</li>
                    <li>• <strong>B-Complex Vitamins:</strong> Once daily. Support energy production, metabolism, and thyroid function. 
                    Choose methylated forms (methylcobalamin B12).</li>
                    <li>• <strong>L-Tyrosine:</strong> 500-1,000mg daily on empty stomach. Amino acid building block for thyroid hormones. 
                    May help with energy and focus.</li>
                    <li>• <strong>Ashwagandha:</strong> 600mg daily. Adaptogen that may support healthy thyroid function and reduce cortisol. 
                    (Consult doctor if Hashimoto's)</li>

                  <li>• <strong>Iodine:</strong> Don't supplement iodine without testing levels first. Excess iodine can worsen 
                  Hashimoto's and hypothyroidism. Get from food (fish, seaweed in moderation).</li>
                  <li>• <strong>Kelp/Seaweed supplements:</strong> Avoid - unpredictable iodine content can harm thyroid.</li>
                  <li>• <strong>Take separately from thyroid medication:</strong> Calcium, iron, and fiber supplements interfere with 
                  levothyroxine. Space 4+ hours apart.</li>
